# DW::LatestFeed
#
# This module is the "frontend" for the latest feed.  You call this module to
# insert something into the feed or get the feed back in a consumable fashion.
# There is a lot of room for optimization to make this process more efficient
# but for now I haven't really done that.
#
# Also note, if memcache is cleared, the latest things go away and have to be
# repopulated from scratch.  This is not good behavior from the user experience
# aspect, but it's OK for this feature.
