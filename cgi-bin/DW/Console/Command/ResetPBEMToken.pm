Dear username,

A $sitename administrator has reset the secret token for your account to use to post comments by email. We had to reset the token, because your account was being used to email spam to the unique reply-to address for one or more comment notifications you received.

Usually this happens because someone got access to your email account and 'harvested' the addresses from messages that were in your inbox. We strongly suggest that you change the password for your email account. We don't know for sure that a spammer broke into your account, but that's usually how a situation like this happens, and it's better to be safe than sorry.

Any old comment notification emails you have in your inbox that were sent to you before your token was changed will no longer work to reply by email. You'll need to follow the links in those notification emails to reply directly on the website. Any comment notification email sent to you after the token was changed will work as usual.

If you have any questions, you can reply to this email.

Best,
The $sitename Team
}
