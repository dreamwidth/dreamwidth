=head1 NAME

DW::Worker::ContentImporter::Local::Comments - Local data utilities for comments

=head1 Comments

These functions are part of the Saving API for comments.

=head2 C<< $class->clear_caches() >>

This needs to be called between each import. This ensures we clear out the local caches
so we don't bleed data from one import to the next.

=cut

sub clear_caches {
    $EntryCache = undef;
    $UserCache = undef;
}

=head2 C<< $class->precache( $u, $jitemid_hash, $userid_hash ) >>

Given a user and two hashrefs (keys are jitemids and then userids respectively), this
will do a bulk load of those items and precache them. This is designed to be used
right before we import a bunch of comments to give us some performance and save all
the roundtrips.

=cut

sub precache {
    my ( $class, $u, $jitemids, $userids ) = @_;

    $UserCache = LJ::load_userids( @$userids );

    foreach my $jitemid ( @$jitemids ) {
        $EntryCache->{$jitemid} = LJ::Entry->new( $u, jitemid => $jitemid );
    }
    LJ::Entry->preload_props_all();
}

=head2 C<< $class->get_comment_map( $user, $hashref ) >>

Returns a hashref mapping import_source keys to jtalkids. This really shouldn't
fail or we get into awkward duplication states.

=cut

sub get_comment_map {
    my ( $class, $u ) = @_;

    my $p = LJ::get_prop( "talk", "import_source" )
        or die "Failed to load import_source property.";
    my $dbr = LJ::get_cluster_reader( $u )
        or die "Failed to get database reader for user.";
    my $sth = $dbr->prepare( "SELECT jtalkid, value FROM talkprop2 WHERE journalid = ? AND tpropid = ?" )
        or die "Failed to allocate statement handle.";
    $sth->execute( $u->id, $p->{id} )
        or die "Failed to execute query.";

    my %map;
    while ( my ( $jitemid, $value ) = $sth->fetchrow_array ) {
        $map{$value} = $jitemid;
    }
    return \%map;
}


=head2 C<< $class->update_comment( $u, $comment, $errref ) >>

Called by the importer when it has gotten a copy of a comment and wants to make sure that our local
copy of a comment is syncronized.

$comment is a hashref representation of a single comment, same as for <<insert_comment>>.

$errref is a scalar reference to put any error text in.

=cut

sub update_comment {
    my ( $class, $u, $cmt, $errref ) = @_;
    $errref ||= '';

    # FIXME: we should try to do more than just update the picture keyword, this should handle
    # edits and such.  for now, I'm just trying to get the icons to update...
    my $c = LJ::Comment->instance( $u, jtalkid => $cmt->{id} )
        or return $$errref = 'Unable to instantiate LJ::Comment object.';

    # so we don't load the bodies of every comment ever
    # (most of the time, we don't need to)
    # empty body of a nondeleted comment indicates something went wrong with the import process
    if ( $LJ::FIX_COMMENT_IMPORT{$u->user} && ! $c->is_deleted && $c->body_raw == "" ) {
        $c->set_subject_and_body( $cmt->{subject}, $cmt->{body} );
    }

    my $pu = $c->poster;
    if ( $pu && $pu->userpic_have_mapid ) {
        $c->set_prop( picture_mapid => $pu->get_mapid_from_keyword( $cmt->{props}->{picture_keyword}, create => 1 ) );
    } else {
        $c->set_prop( picture_keyword => $cmt->{props}->{picture_keyword} );
    }
}


=head2 C<< $class->insert_comment( $u, $comment, $errref ) >>

$comment is a hashref representation of a single comment, with the following format:

  {
    subject => "Comment",
    body => 'I DID STUFF!!!!!',
    posterid => $local_userid,

    jitemid => $local_jitemid,

    parentid => $local_parent,

    props => { ... }, # hashref of talkprops

    state => 'A',
  }

$errref is a scalar reference to put any error text in.

    my $user = $cmt->{posterid} ? ( $UserCache->{$cmt->{posterid}} || LJ::load_userid( $cmt->{posterid} ) ) : undef;

    # fix the XML timestamp to a useful timestamp

    $date =~ s/T/ /;

    # sometimes the date is empty
    $date ||= LJ::mysql_time();

    # remove properties that we don't know or care about
    foreach my $name ( keys %{$cmt->{props} || {}} ) {
        delete $cmt->{props}->{$name}
            unless LJ::get_prop( talk => $name ) &&
                ( $name ne 'import_source' && $name ne 'imported_from' );
    }

    my $comment = {

        body => $cmt->{body},

        # the enter_imported_comment function can demote them back to properties

        preformat       => delete $cmt->{props}->{opt_preformatted},
        subjecticon     => delete $cmt->{props}->{subjecticon},
        unknown8bit     => delete $cmt->{props}->{unknown8bit},

        props => {
            import_source => $source,
            imported_from => $cmt->{source},
            %{$cmt->{props} || {}},
        },

        no_urls => 1,
        no_esn => 1,
    };

    my $item = {
        itemid => $cmt->{jitemid},
    };

    my $parent = {
        talkid => $cmt->{parentid},
    };

    # now try to import it and return this as the error code
    return LJ::Talk::Post::enter_imported_comment( $u, $parent, $item, $comment, $date, \$errref );
