<title>S2 Language Overview</title>

<para>The S2 language is an object-oriented and statically-typed language
with syntax mostly borrowed from Perl, but with some borrowings from other languages
including Java and Python.</para>

<para>This language is domain-specific, which means that it has a reduced
feature set compared to general-purpose programming languages you may be familiar with.
In particular, the flow control constructs available are restricted to
conditional branching (<quote>if</quote> statements) and iteration over finite
lists (<quote>foreach</quote> loops).</para>

<para>The language has several features which are designed to make life easier:
    <itemizedlist>
        <listitem><simpara>Variables can be referenced from within string
        literals, in which case their values will be interpolated into the resulting string.
        This behavior is similar to perl.</simpara></listitem>
        <listitem><simpara>String literals can be given enclosed in three
        sets of quotes (<literal>"""</literal>), which allows quote characters
        to be included within the string unescaped. This is useful for producing
        HTML which features lots of quote symbols.</simpara></listitem>
        <listitem><simpara>String expressions can be used as statements,
        causing their value to be implicitly output to the client.</simpara></listitem>
        <listitem><simpara><emphasis>Properties</emphasis> can be defined
        which are special global variables exposed from a layer to be set
        from other layers or from a friendly customization interface.</simpara></listitem>
    </itemizedlist></para>

<para>This section serves as a reference guide for the S2 language. Anyone
who is familiar with procedural programming should be right at home. If you
have not done programming before, you may like to get an idea of the concepts
behind programming before you begin.</para>

to a different variable type.</para>

determines which function will be called, not the type of the variable on
which the arrow operator is applied.</para>

  <section id="&s2.idroot;langref.operators.other">
  <title>Other Operators</title>

<para>These operators don't really fit into a category of their own, and
have perhaps non-obvious functions.</para>

    <section>
    <title>The assignment operator: <literal>=</literal></title>

    <para>The assignment operator (which should not be confused with the
    equality test operator, <literal>==</literal>), is used to assign a value
    to a named variable. This means that unlike most other operators, its left
    operand <emphasis>must</emphasis> be a variable name. No other kind of
    expression will do.</para>

    <para>The assignment operator can take operands of any type, but the
    right-hand operand must be of the same type as the variable given on the left, or
    <emphasis>coercable</emphasis> into that type.</para>

    <para>The assignment operator also returns whatever value it has just
    assigned to the variable, meaning that you can chain several assignments
    together as follows:
    <programlisting>$foo = $bar = $baz = 2;</programlisting>
    In this case, <varname>$foo</varname>, <varname>$bar</varname> and
    <varname>$baz</varname> will all be assigned the value 2.</para>

    <para>As a special case, assignment can also be used when declaring local
    variables:
    <programlisting>var string $name = "John";</programlisting>
    However, this is only true for local variables. Class variables cannot be
    initialized in this way.</para>

    <para>The symbol <literal>=</literal> is used for several other
    assignment-like things in the S2 language, including setting property
    values and layerinfo. These aren't really assignment, but act similarly
    and in the case of property setting follow many of the rules described
    above.</para>

    </section>

    <section>
    <title>String Concatenation with <literal>+</literal></title>

    <para>The <literal>+</literal> symbol actually has two purposes in the S2
    language. When one of its operands is a string, it becomes
    the <emphasis>string concatenation operator</emphasis>.
    In this form, it will firstly attempt to coerce any non-string operand
    into a string, then stick the two strings together to form a resulting
    string which is returned.</para>

    <para>The simplest form of string concatenation involves two strings.
    In this case, both strings are just concatenated and that is it. However,
    as long as one operand remains a string, the other operand can be an
    integer, a boolean or an object with certain conditions. Objects may
    only be concatenated to strings if their class has
    an <function>as_string()</function> method which returns a string.
    The return value of this method will be used as the string value for
    concatenation.</para>

    <para>String literals with interpolated variables are really just concatenation
    with a more convenient syntax, which is why you are able to interpolate
    integers and certain objects directly into string literals.</para>

    </section>

    <section>
    <title>The ternary conditional operator <literal>? :</literal></title>

    <para>This is the only operator in the S2 language with three operands.
    Its function can be thought of as being like an
    <literal>if</literal> statement in the form of an operator.</para>

    <para>This operator is best explained with an example:
    <programlisting>$label = ($c == 1 ? "1 comment" : "$c comments");</programlisting>
    In this example, the conditional operator and its operands are enclosed
    in parenthesis for clarity. These are optional, but can make things more
    readable. The first operand, preceding the question-mark symbol, is a
    boolean expression. In this case it is an equality test. If this
    expression evaluates to true, the second operand, which is after the
    question-mark and before the colon, is returned. If the expression is
    false, the third operand is returned.</para>

    <para>The first operand <emphasis>must</emphasis> be a boolean
    expression. The second and third operands can be of any type but their
    types must match. The return type of this operator is the same as that
    of the second and third operand. In the above example, then, the return
    type would be string.</para>

    <para>In all cases an <literal>if</literal> construct can be used in place
    of this operator, but the conditional operator is shorter and more readable
    in some cases.</para>

    </section>

    <section>
    <title>The range operator <literal>..</literal></title>

    <para>This rather quirky operator is borrowed from Perl. It takes two
    integer operands and returns an array of integers containing all integers
    between the first and second operand, inclusive. For example:
    <programlisting>var int[] list = 1 .. 10;</programlisting>
    The array <varname>$list</varname> will now contain ten elements,
    each numbered in order from 1 to 10. This has the same effect as:
    <programlisting>var int[] list = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10];</programlisting></para>

    <para>This operator is really only useful for creating a loop which will
    iterate a certain number of times:
    <programlisting>foreach var int i (1 .. 10) { println "Iteration number $i"; }</programlisting>
    This example will print ten lines, each containing a number from 1 to 10
    in order.</para>

    <note><para>Some readers will probably balk at the use of an array of
    integers to create a loop such as this, as it would use more memory than a
    conventional <literal>for</literal> loop from a general programming
    language.</para>

    <para>However, you don't have to worry. The above idiom is optimised
    to an efficient form at compile time, so there is no memory wasted.</para></note>

<title>Functions</title>

<para>Functions in S2 can be simple functions, methods of a class, or call
functions written in the backend language from the <literal>builtin</literal>
layer.</para>

<para>Functions can return data in any simple internal datatype, or
<returnvalue>void</returnvalue> if no return data is required.</para>

  <section id='&s2.idroot;langref.functions.declaration'>
    <title>Declaration</title>

    <para>Declaring a function within a class is done as follows:
    <programlisting>class SomeClass { function do_stuff(int para1, string para2) : string;
    }</programlisting></para>

    <para>This declares a function called <methodname>do_stuff</methodname> in the
    <classname>SomeClass</classname> class with two parameters and which
    returns a string. The colon and type keyword may be omitted where a function will
    return <returnvalue>void</returnvalue> (no value).</para>


    <para>Functions outside classes are declared in the same way:
    <programlisting>function do_global_stuff(int para1, string para2);</programlisting></para>

    <para>Functions outside classes do not need to be declared, but if they are
    not declared they must be defined before they are called.</para>

    <para>Built-in functions can be declared in the core layer using the
    <literal>builtin</literal> keyword in the function prototype:
    <programlisting>function builtin ehtml(string s) : string; class string { function builtin ends_with (string sub) : bool;
    }</programlisting></para>
    <para>Functions can have some or no parameters, in the latter case the
    parentheses may be omitted in declaration. If several functions of the same
    name exist with different parameters, they can be defined as follows:</para>
    <programlisting>function dostuff(int para1); function dostuff;</programlisting>

    <para>Non-class (global) functions can be implemented when they are
    declared:
    <programlisting>function do_global_stuff() { print "I'm doing stuff!";
    }</programlisting></para>

    <para>Class functions (methods) must first be declared within the class
    they will apply to, and can then be implemented outside the class declaration as
    follows:
    <programlisting>function SomeClass::do_stuff() { print "I'm doing stuff!";
    }</programlisting></para>

    <para>It is not permitted to implement a <literal>builtin</literal> function.
    These will instead be mapped onto some code written in the host language in
    the S2 backend.</para>

    <para>Layouts are allowed to add new methods to a class without pre-declaration,
    but with a few special constraints. Firstly, the method must be declared
    and implemented before it is used. Secondly, the method name must begin
    with <literal>lay_</literal>, to avoid problems in the future when new
    methods may be added to the core layer with the same name.</para>

  <title>Properties</title>

<para>Properties are single values which are exposed by the core and layout
layers and set in all subsequent layers to configure aspects of a style.
Properties can be of any primitive type as well as any class which provides
both an  <function>as_string()</function> function which returns a string
representation of its data and a constructor function named after the class
which accepts a <parameter>string</parameter> as a parameter and returns an
object based on that string.</para>

<para>The purpose of properties is to expose certain configuration settings
of a style such that they can be set from a friendly <quote>wizard</quote>-like
interface.</para>
