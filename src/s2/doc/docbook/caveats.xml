    <title>Untrusted layers printing incomplete HTML.</title>
  <para>All output from the print command in untrusted layers gets piped
  through the HTML cleaner which militantly cleans HTML, removing anything
  that's harmful or potentially harmful. Because styles can contain both user
  layers and trusted system layers, both of which can be printing, a print from
  a trusted layer flushes the HTML cleaner's buffer, forcing it to finish
  earlier than it might otherwise wish to. For instance, if an untrusted layer
  prints out an incomplete tag, normally the HTML cleaner waits until it sees
  the rest before sending it along to the client. But if a trusted layer forces
  a flush, the HTML cleaner may be confused and forced to over-escape a lot of
  HTML to be safe.</para>
  <para>To avoid this problem print only complete tags at once, or avoid
  calling other code which may switch into trusted code.</para>
