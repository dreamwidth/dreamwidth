Lua Target for S2
-----------------

The Lua target compiles layers to Lua code which can then be used
in situations where a Lua interpreter is available. Lua is a
scripting language popular for embedding into applications due to
its compact compiler/runtime, its speed and its portability.

This target is experimental, and has not been used in any production
applications. It currently lacks a runtime library, and is thus not
of much practical use.

To use:
    s2compile --output lua ...

The backend generates a source file that "returns" the layer. The
layer can be loaded by running the source file and storing the
return value. You can do this either in Lua's C API (load the
script into the stack and do lua_pcall) or from a Lua script
if your Lua instance has an "include" function of some description.
