    --once      Only run once; useful if you're using this worker in cron.
    --help      See this help/usage document.

In general, this worker should be scheduled by worker-manager (see etc/workers.conf)
and then it will just constantly ensure your syndicated accounts are being updated.

You will need to ensure you have scheduled synsuck workers.
