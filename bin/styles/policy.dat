# Do not modify this file.  To set the S2-usage policy for your own
# LiveJournal-based site, create a file beside this one called
# policy-local.dat, based on instructions you find in this document.
# That file will override anything not set here.
#
# 'allow' means all users get access.  'deny' means only users with
# the 's2styles' capability get access.
#

# Default policy for layouts without their own policy section.
layer: *
        use allow     # can all users use it?
        props allow   # can all users modify any property of it?

# If you decide to make your site's default policy for * to be 'deny',
# then you'll have to selectively allow access to parts, like so:

#layer: generator/layout
#  use allow
#  props deny
#  prop page_bgcolor allow

# Notes:
#    -- allowing/denying access to properties is only valid on
#       layout and core layers.  
#    -- you can't disallow use of a core layer, or i18n layers.
#    -- for theme layers, you can only set the 'use' property.

layer: */themes
        use allow     # can all users use it?

# To deny use of certain themes:
#
#layer: generator/mintchoc
#  use deny
