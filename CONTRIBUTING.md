# Contributing to Dreamwidth

We love having new contributors join us! Here's the quick summary of where to find information on contributing to Dreamwidth:

* Register a [Dreamwidth Bugzilla account](http://bugs.dwscoalition.org)
* Make sure you have a [GitHub account](https://github.com/signup/free)
* Dreamwidth is a highly complicated web app with tons of dependencies. You don't need to get it working locally just to contribute: we do it all for you. You can do it if you want, but it's a lot easier if you let us do it! The easiest thing to do is to sign up for a [Dreamhack account](http://hack.dreamwidth.net/) -- our hosted developer service. 
* Read the [Dev Getting Started](http://wiki.dwscoalition.org/wiki/index.php/Dev_Getting_Started) wiki guide.
* Check the [Programming Guidelines](http://wiki.dwscoalition.org/wiki/index.php/Programming_Guidelines)
* Send in a [Contributor Licensing Agreement](http://wiki.dwscoalition.org/wiki/index.php/Contributor_Licensing_Agreement)
* Start hacking!
