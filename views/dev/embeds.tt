<p>[% site.nameshort %] curates a whitelist of allowed domains and formats for embed codes shared from other sites.</p>

<p>If the site you are trying to use is included on this list, but it doesn't seem to be working in your journal, please <a href="/support/submit">open a support request</a> so we can investigate. You should include in your support request the exact code you are trying to use, so that we can compare it with what our code is expecting.</p>

<p>If the site you are trying to use is <em>not</em> included on this list, we might be able to include it in the future! Look at the embed code you are trying to use and:</p>

<ul>
<li style="margin-bottom: 1em;">... if it uses &lt;script&gt; tags, sorry! We can't allow embed codes that use script tags, for security reasons.</li>

<li style="margin-bottom: 1em;">... if it does <em>not</em> use &lt;script&gt; tags (or you're not sure either way), you can send the code to us in a <a href="/support/submit">support request</a>. The support team will forward your request to the development team.</li>
</ul>
