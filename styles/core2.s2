class Redirector
"A redirector makes either a GET URL which redirects to a pretty URL or an HTML form which posts to a URL that redirects to a pretty URL.

It's also used in cases where finding the previous or next URL would incur database overhead which would be wasteful, considering most people don't click previous/next links.  Instead, the system will give you a Redirector object which has a URL that'll do the lookup for you later, followed by a redirect."
