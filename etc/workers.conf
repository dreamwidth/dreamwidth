dfw-lb01:
    lazy-cleanup: 5
    birthday-notify: 1

# net result of the above: if you run worker-manager on dfw-foobar01
# there will be 1 lazy-cleanup process and 0 birthday-notify jobs, but
# if you run on dfw-lb01 then we will get 5 lazy-cleanup and one of
# the birthday notifier



# here's a list of workers grouped by function
# you'll need to copy these into the appropriate section above
#   if you're on a dev server, easiest would be to just put them under "all"
# remember that workers use up resources when they're running
#    make sure to use only what you need
