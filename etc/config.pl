# THIS FILE IS INTENDED FOR EXAMPLE/DOCUMENTATION PURPOSES ONLY.

# Ideally, any configuration changes for your site should go in
# config-local.pl or config-private.pl.  If you feel like you need
# a site-specific config.pl, make sure you copy it to ext/local/etc
# and customize it there.  This will protect it from getting clobbered
# when you upgrade to the newest Dreamwidth code in the future, but
# you will not automatically inherit additions or updates to this file.
