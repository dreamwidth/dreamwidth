Dear [[touser]],

We wanted to let you know that your [[sitename]] community 
[[commname]]'s paid time has now expired.

You can add more paid time to the community in the [[sitename]] shop:

  [[shopurl]]

If you don't renew your community's paid time, don't worry -- the 
community will still be there for you and your members to post in.
You just won't have access to the paid account features anymore. 

We really hope that you'll consider renewing your paid time, though.
All of our income comes entirely from your payments -- we don't take
money from any outside investors, just from our users for the 
service we provide. If there's anything we could be doing better,
or anything we could do to make you more satisfied with the service,
we'd love to hear from you. You can email us at:

  feedback@dreamwidth.org

Even if you decide not to renew your paid [[sitename]] account,
we're still really glad to have you here. Thanks for your support.

Best,
 Denise, Mark, and the [[sitename]] team

Dear [[touser]],

We wanted to let you know that your paid [[sitename]] community,
[[commname]], will be expiring in two weeks. 

If you'd like, you can add more paid time to your community account
here:

  [[shopurl]]

If you don't want to renew your community's paid account, don't worry -- it'll still be there for you to use. You and your community members just
won't have access to all of the paid account features. You can see a list of those paid account features here:

  https://www.dreamwidth.org/support/faqbrowse?faqid=4

[[sitename]] is supported entirely by your payments. We aren't owned
by a corporate conglomerate, we haven't taken any venture capital from
outside investors, and we don't accept advertising, so we're 100%
focused on making you happy with our service and our site. If there's
anything at all that you think we're not doing right, or if there's 
something that we could do better, we'd love to hear from you. You
can email us at:

  feedback@dreamwidth.org

Thank you so much for supporting Dreamwidth and making it possible
for us to build an awesome service.

shop.expiration.comm.3.body<<
Dear [[touser]],

We just wanted to remind you that your paid [[sitename]] community,
[[commname]], will be expiring in approximately three days.

You can renew your paid account in our Shop:

  [[shopurl]]

This is the last reminder we'll send you -- we don't want to nag! 
Your community will automatically revert to a free account in 
another three days if you don't renew. If that happens, you'll still
be able to use it; you just won't have access to our paid features
anymore. You can see a list of those paid features here:

    https://www.dreamwidth.org/support/faqbrowse?faqid=4
