                    (the Suit) began working on the
                    LiveJournal.com project in 2001. Since then, she's done everything from
                    customer service to product planning to documentation to user advocacy
                    to QA testing to falling over exhausted because she's trying to do too
                    much at once. She left LiveJournal in 2007 to pursue a career in
                    writing. She hopes that with Dreamwidth Studios, she'll be able to use
                    her experience to create a place where creative people of all types will
                    find a home for their expression where they feel safe, welcomed, and
                    supported.

                    Denise lives in Baltimore, Maryland, with her long-suffering
                    wife, who fortunately enjoys the frequent "c'mere, look, isn't
                    this <em>cool</em>?" invocations, and three cats, who don't care about
                    the internet as long as they get fed on time.

                    (the Geek) began volunteering with LiveJournal.com in 2001 in technical
                    support and code development. He joined the staff in 2004, where he
                    contributed heavily to all areas of the site and worked on utilities
                    such as Perlbal and MogileFS that are now used by many other web sites.
                    After transitioning to Six Apart, Mark worked to design and build out
                    the systems infrastructure for the Vox.com product launch.
                - |
                    Since those days, Mark has been a MySQL DBA, managed an operations team,
                    and maintained a cadre of open source projects of his own while working
                    for companies such as Google, Mozilla, and Bump.

                    He currently resides near San Francisco, CA with his partner, Ari, and
                    their two small sons. In his free time, he enjoys motorcycles, tabletop
                    and LARP gaming, and amateur radio (license KC8BCW).

                    is Dreamwidth's backup sysadmin on call, helping Mark wrangle servers
                    and keeping an eye out for problems. He has approximately two decades of
                    experience with Unix systems and open source, resulting in ninja-like reflexes
                    for troubleshooting and bug hunting. He became <s>disillusioned</s> familiar
                    with the LiveJournal codebase in 2006 when Brad announced a cross-site
                    scripting contest offering permanent accounts for reporting security bugs
                    (Alierak won three and maintains a healthy mistrust of our HTML cleaner).
                - |
                    He is also a sysadmin at a major university, husband and father of two, and
                    enjoys building or fixing things, cooking, and playing with math. He can
                    often be found singing or playing various instruments in church.

                    does Terms of Service enforcement because Mark
                    asked her to, and submits tons of Bugzilla patches because it's fun.  An
                    MIT graduate, she has been on the internet since before the invention of
                    this newfangled "World Wide Web" thing.  She runs the MU* where Mark &amp;
                    Janine met, which lets her claim indirect partial responsibility for the
                    existence of Dreamwidth.  You're welcome.

                    Jen is passionate about computers, communities, crafts, all varieties
                    of music, speculative fiction, space exploration... basically the whole
                    damn universe.  She grew up and currently lives in the reddest of the
                    red states, but also spent 12 years residing in the bluest of the blue
                    states, so she is used to navigating ideological extremes.  After spending
                    several years working as top-tier IT support in a non-profit organization,
                    she changed gears and is now a full-time mom to two precious, precocious
                    children.

                    came into the LiveJournal volunteer IRC channel during one of the early
                    data center "power events" to find out what was going on. Denise obtained
                    another minion shortly thereafter. Azz specializes in thoughtful analysis
                    of any social media system she immerses herself in, and enjoys finding the
                    root needs underlying any request for more bells and whistles, and thinking
                    up a way to fulfil that need that fits in with the site's gestalt and actually
                    could be implemented. She was in IRC not looking busy enough when Denise and
                    Mark needed a team leader for spam, and now enjoys squashing spammers.

                    By day, Azz is a mild-mannered minion in the cloudy part of Silicon Valley
                    (and lives in the foggy part of the Bay Area). She dreamed of becoming a
                    Communications Officer like Lt. Uhura when she was a child; now she spends
                    most of her commute using a suspiciously similar headset. Her hobbies include
                    talking to Kat, crocheting, IRC, and having bizarre, one-sided conversations
                    with the characters in her current draft novel.

                    co-leads the accessibility team. She spends her time writing accessibility
                    improvements for the Dreamwidth code, as well as educating the other developers
                    and designers about accessibility. In her other life she works in library
                    technology, where she's gained a reputation as That Person Who Will Glare
                    at You If Your Library Software Isn't Accessible.

                    serves as Dreamwidth's executive assistant, which involves
                    much filing of paperwork and weekly trips to the credit union. Yes, she
                    will get you coffee, but only if she's already getting some for herself.
                    And if you drink it full-octane. And if she can find a second clean mug.
                - |
                    Sarah's superpowers include paying the bills on time, keeping the taxman
                    from battering down the door, and keeping the pantry she shares with
                    Denise well-stocked with Diet Coke with Lime.
