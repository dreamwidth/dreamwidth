CODE TOUR: summarize here.

<!--
Above, please explain how these changes affect users. This summary must be a single line that starts with the text `CODE TOUR:`.

The rest of your PR description is for other developers, but the CODE TOUR line is for whoever writes the next code tour post. See https://dw-dev.dreamwidth.org/tag/code+tour for examples.

If this PR has no direct effect on users, write a summary anyway, but include the text `no-impact` as a hint for sorting.
