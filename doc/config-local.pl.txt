# directory to etc/config-local.pl and edit as necessary.  The reason
# it's not in the etc directory already is to protect it from
# getting clobbered when you upgrade to the newest Dreamwidth code in
# the future.

# This, and config-private.pl should be the only files you need to 
# change to get the Dreamwidth code to run on your site. Variables
# which are set by $DW::PRIVATE::... should be configured in 
# config-private.pl instead.

# Use the  checkconfig.pl utility to find any other config variables 
# that might not be documented here. You should be able to set config 
# values here and have the DW code run; if you have to modify the
# code itself, it's a bug and you should report it.
