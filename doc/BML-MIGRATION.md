# Migrating BML pages to Template Toolkit

BML ("Block Markup Language") is the 20+-year-old LiveJournal page format that
mixes Perl, HTML, and translation calls in a single `.bml` file under `htdocs/`.
It is deprecated. We are steadily converting BML pages to the modern Dreamwidth
architecture, which separates the three concerns:

| Concern | BML (old) | Modern (new) |
|---------|-----------|--------------|
| Logic   | `<?_code … _code?>` blocks in `htdocs/<path>.bml` | a controller in `cgi-bin/DW/Controller/…pm` |
| Markup  | HTML in the same `.bml` file | a Template Toolkit template in `views/<path>.tt` |
| Strings | `htdocs/<path>.bml.text` | `views/<path>.tt.text` |

This document is the how-to; worked examples are collected in §10.

> **Scope: faithful behavior, restyled markup.** Move the page off BML and keep
> its *behavior* the same — same URL, same form field names, same actions, same
> strings. The markup, however, is restyled to **Foundation** as part of the
> conversion (see §3): activate the `foundation` resource group, lay the body
> out with the row/columns grid, and build controls with the `form.*` helpers.
> Because the page *will* look different, every migration is validated visually
> with screenshots — and you must capture the BML page's states **before** you
> convert, so the PR can show a before/after comparison (see §13).

> **Run everything in the devcontainer.** All commands below assume you are
> inside the devcontainer (`$LJHOME` = `/workspaces/dreamwidth`). See
> `CLAUDE.md` for container setup, and always work in a git worktree.

## 0. Before you start: migrate, deprecate, or leave it

Not every `.bml` should be migrated — some are dead or already superseded. Check
before you port:

- **Trace who actually uses the page.** Grep the route and its old ML keys across
  the tree, and see whether the *modern* flow already references it:
  ```bash
  grep -rn "/imgupload" htdocs/js views cgi-bin
  grep -rn "imgupload.bml\." views cgi-bin   # old ML keys
  ```
  Watch for **beta-gated redirects** (`LJ::BetaFeatures->user_in_beta(...)`) that
  already send real users to a newer page.

- **Deprecate instead of migrate** when a page is superseded by a beta/newer page
  and only kept during rollout. Don't port dead code — add a note at the top
  pointing at the replacement, to be removed once the new page leaves beta:
  ```
  <?_c
  # DEPRECATED: superseded by the new TT <thing> (DW::Controller::Foo, /foo).
  # Kept only while the new page is in beta; remove once it leaves beta.
  _c?>
  ```
  (See the deprecation notes on `/update` and `/imgupload`.)

- **Beware dual-role pages.** A page can have a still-live role *and* a superseded
  one. `/editjournal` is both an entry *picker* (still linked from the nav) and a
  per-entry *edit form* (which redirects to the beta editor) — only the form is
  replaced, so it must **not** be blanket-deprecated. Read the whole page's
  responsibilities before deciding.

When a page is live and not superseded, migrate it — the rest of this guide is how.

---

## 1. Anatomy of a migration

A single `.bml` page becomes (typically) three new files, plus small edits to a
couple of shared files:

```
htdocs/manage/invites.bml         ─┐
                                   ├─►  cgi-bin/DW/Controller/Manage/Invites.pm   (logic)
                                   └─►  views/manage/invites.tt                   (markup)
htdocs/manage/invites.bml.text     ──►  views/manage/invites.tt.text             (strings; git mv)
htdocs/stc/invites.css             ──►  inlined into the .tt, or kept as a file   (styles)

bin/upgrading/deadphrases.dat      ◄──  retire the old `/…bml.*` translation keys
cgi-bin/Apache/LiveJournal.pm      ◄──  remove any hard-coded `.bml` route/redirect (some pages)
any caller of the old ML keys      ◄──  repoint `dw.ml('/old.bml.key')` → new `.tt` key
```

The URL stays the same: `htdocs/manage/invites.bml` was served at `/manage/invites`,
and the controller registers exactly that path.

**Some pages produce only two files.** If a page renders no markup of its own —
every code path is a redirect or a whole-page `error_ml`/`success_ml` message,
typical of a pure action endpoint — there is no template to write. You get just
the controller and the renamed `.tt.text`; skip the `.tt`. (`/support/actmulti`
is one: it closes / moves requests and redirects, with no page body of its own.)

---

## 2. The controller

Create `cgi-bin/DW/Controller/<Name>.pm`. Controllers are auto-loaded — there is
no registry to update; the `register_string` call at load time wires up the route.

Minimal skeleton:

```perl
package DW::Controller::Manage::Invites;

use strict;

use DW::Controller;
use DW::Routing;
use DW::Template;

DW::Routing->register_string( "/manage/invites", \&invites_handler, app => 1 );

sub invites_handler {
    my ( $ok, $rv ) = controller( anonymous => 0, form_auth => 1 );
    return $rv unless $ok;

    my $r = $rv->{r};
    my $u = $rv->{u};

    # ... build display-ready data, stuff it into $rv ...
    $rv->{invites} = \@invites;

    return DW::Template->render_template( 'manage/invites.tt', $rv );
}

1;
```

### The `controller()` helper

`controller()` (from `DW::Controller`) replaces the BML login/captcha/`$remote`
boilerplate. It returns `( $ok, $rv )`; on failure `$rv` is a ready-to-return
error/redirect response, so the idiom is always:

```perl
my ( $ok, $rv ) = controller( … );
return $rv unless $ok;
```

On success `$rv` is a hashref pre-seeded with:

- `$rv->{r}` — the `DW::Request` object
- `$rv->{remote}` — the logged-in viewer (or `undef`)
- `$rv->{u}` — the *target* user (same as `remote` unless `authas`/`specify_user`)
- `$rv->{authas_html}` / `$rv->{authas_form}` — when `authas` is requested

Pass `$rv` straight to `render_template` as the variable hash; add your own keys
to it as you go.

Common options (full list in `cgi-bin/DW/Controller.pm`):

| Option | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| `anonymous => 1` | allow logged-out visitors (default `0` = require login) |
| `form_auth => 1` | auto-check the CSRF token on POST (pair with `[% dw.form_auth %]`) |
| `authas => 1` or `authas => { … }` | allow `?authas=`, build the switch-user form |
| `specify_user => 1` | allow `?user=` to load `$rv->{u}` |
| `privcheck => [ … ]` | require one of the listed privs |
| `skip_captcha => 1` | never captcha (use sparingly) |

`privcheck` only handles **global** privs. For access that depends on the object
— "can edit *this* category", "can view at least one of N things" — do the
checks yourself after `controller()` returns and bail with `error_ml`:

```perl
my $canedit = $remote->has_priv( 'admin', "supporthelp/$catkey" )
           || $remote->has_priv( 'admin', 'supporthelp' );
return error_ml("$ml_scope.not.have.access.to.actions")
    if $r->did_post && !$canedit;
```

### Routing

```perl
DW::Routing->register_string( "/manage/invites", \&handler, app => 1 );  # exact path
DW::Routing->register_regex( '^/confirm/(\w+\.\w+)', \&handler, app => 1 ); # captures → @_
```

`app => 1` means the site-app context (the normal case). One controller may
register several routes (e.g. `/register` plus `/confirm/…`). Pass
`no_cache => 1` for pages that must not be cached — admin/support tools and
anything with mutating actions (e.g. `/support/stock_answers`).

### Reading input

Use the `DW::Request` accessors — they replace BML's `%GET` / `%POST` /
`LJ::did_post()`:

```perl
$r->did_post          # was: LJ::did_post()
$r->post_args->{user} # was: $POST{user}
$r->get_args->{foo}   # was: $GET{foo}
$r->query_string
```

A `multiple` `<select>` (or any repeated field) posts its name several times.
`$r->post_args` is a `Hash::MultiValue`, so scalar access `$r->post_args->{tags}`
returns only **one** of them — use `get_all` to read them all:

```perl
my @selected = $r->post_args->get_all('tags');   # was: split /\0/, $POST{tags}
```

Missing this silently processes a single item (e.g. a "merge tags" action that
only merges one of the selected tags). It won't show up in single-item testing.

Plain hash idioms otherwise work on a `Hash::MultiValue` — `keys %$post` is fine
for scanning field names (e.g. a form whose field names are object ids, like the
mood theme editor's `<moodid>`, `<moodid>w`, `<moodid>inherit` family).

### Handling form submissions (POST)

With `form_auth => 1`, `controller()` validates the CSRF token on every POST for
you. Beyond that, two patterns:

- **Multiple actions on one page** — give each submit button a distinct name
  (`action:new`, `action:save`, `action:delete`) and dispatch on it:
  ```perl
  if ( $post->{'action:delete'} ) { ... }
  if ( $post->{'action:new'} || $post->{'action:save'} ) { ... }
  ```
- **POST-then-redirect (PRG)** vs **POST-then-render.** For create/update/delete
  that changes state, do the work and `return $r->redirect(...)` — usually back to
  the same page with a flag (`?...&saved=1`) the GET branch turns into a success
  message. This avoids duplicate submits on refresh. Use POST-then-render
  (re-render with `DW::FormErrors`) only when you need to show validation errors
  with the user's input preserved (see §5).

### Rendering

```perl
return DW::Template->render_template( 'manage/invites.tt', $rv );
```

The template name is the path under `views/`. The third argument is an `$extra`
hashref of options; the important one is **`no_sitescheme`**:

```perl
# render the template ALONE — it must emit its own full <html> document
return DW::Template->render_template( 'mobile/login.tt', $rv, { no_sitescheme => 1 } );
```

Most pages render *inside* the Foundation site scheme (omit `no_sitescheme`); the
template then supplies only the page body plus `sections.*`. Standalone pages
(the mobile interface, popups, some tools) emit their own `<html>`…`</html>` and
pass `no_sitescheme => 1`.

### Loading CSS/JS (resources)

From the template, `dw.need_res(...)` and `dw.active_resource_group('foundation')`
load page resources. Do it in the **controller** instead when an option needs a
Perl-side value the template can't see — e.g. a config global:

```perl
LJ::set_active_resource_group('jquery');
LJ::need_res( { priority => $LJ::OLD_RES_PRIORITY }, 'stc/subfilters.css' );
LJ::need_res( { group => 'jquery' }, 'js/subfilters.js' );
```

### Redirects

```perl
return $r->redirect( "$LJ::SITEROOT/mobile/?t=" . time() );  # was: BML::redirect(...)
```

### Fixing things as you port

The logic is mostly a verbatim move, but you're already rewriting the surrounding
code — so fix the cheap, safe wins while you're in there. The main ones:

- **Parameterize SQL.** Convert hand-interpolated `$dbh->do("... $val ...")` to
  bound `?` placeholders. It's a free injection fix and never worth carrying
  forward. (`/support/actmulti` did this for category names interpolated into a
  `supportlog` message.)

- **Escape user input echoed back into HTML.** BML pages routinely interpolate
  a submitted value into a result message unescaped — a self-XSS at minimum.
  Wrap it in `LJ::ehtml(...)`. (`/manage/moodthemes` echoed the submitted
  picture URL into its "mood is set to <url>" line raw.)

- **Add missing ownership checks.** A page may verify the user owns an object
  on one action but not another. `/manage/moodthemes` checked ownership for
  *edit* and *delete* but let "use" set any theme id as the journal default —
  the conversion added the same `get_themes({ themeid, ownerid })` check there.

- **Guard latent JS null derefs** when extracting inline JavaScript (§3): BML-era
  scripts often assume an element exists for every object (`getElementById(...)`
  with no null check) and have been throwing quietly for years.

(One more thing to watch for — `.text` values with embedded BML tags — is covered
in §4.)

Keep behavior otherwise faithful — a migration is not the place for feature
changes or refactors beyond this.

---

## 3. The template

Create `views/<path>.tt`. The DW plugins (`dw`, `form`) and the `site` namespace
are loaded automatically (via `_init.tt`), so you can use them without `USE`.

### Sitescheme pages: sections

A sitescheme page provides the body plus named sections rather than a whole
document:

```tt
[%- sections.title = '.title' | ml -%]

[%- sections.head = BLOCK %]
    <style type="text/css"> .action-box { padding: 0 1em; } </style>
[% END -%]

<p>[% '.body.intro' | ml %]</p>
...page body...
```

`sections.title`, `sections.head`, `sections.windowtitle`, `sections.bodyopts`
are the common ones.

### Standalone (`no_sitescheme`) pages: full document

The template emits the entire document, including `<head>`:

```tt
<html>
<head>
<meta name="viewport" content="width = 320" />
<title>[% '.page.title' | ml %]</title>
</head>
<body>
...
</body>
</html>
```

### Restyling to Foundation

Sitescheme pages are restyled to Foundation as part of the conversion. The
ingredients:

```tt
[%- CALL dw.active_resource_group( "foundation" ) -%]
```

- **Grid** — lay out label/field pairs with rows and columns instead of
  `<table>`s or `<br>`-separated runs:
  ```tt
  <div class='row collapse'>
    <div class='columns small-4 medium-2'><label class='inline' for='name'>[% '.label.name' | ml %]</label></div>
    <div class='columns small-8 medium-6 end'>[% form.textbox( name => 'name', id => 'name' ) %]</div>
  </div>
  ```
- **Buttons** — `class => 'button'` on submits; variants compose:
  `'small secondary button'` (e.g. Edit), `'small alert button'` (destructive,
  e.g. Delete). `disabled => cond` renders a disabled control.
- **authas** — use the Foundation-ready `authas_form` (§6), not the legacy
  `authas_html`.
- **Flash messages** — `components/errors.tt` and `$r->add_msg` (§5) already
  emit Foundation markup.

Good references: `views/edittags.tt`, `views/manage/tags.tt`. Keep the page's
*content* — headings, prose, strings, form fields — intact; the restyle is
layout and controls, not a redesign.

### Translated strings

The `| ml` filter is the equivalent of BML's `$ML{'.key'}` / `BML::ml()`:

```tt
[% '.body.pending' | ml %]                            [%# no args %]
[% '.invite.from'  | ml( user => inv.mu.ljuser_display ) %]   [%# with args %]
```

Keys that start with `.` resolve **relative to this template's path** (its
"scope", e.g. `/manage/invites.tt`). Use a full path to reach another page's
string: `dw.ml('/some/other.tt.key')`.

There is also a function form, `dw.ml('.key', arg => …)`, used when the result is
an argument to something else (e.g. a `form.*` helper's `label`). Filter and
function forms are interchangeable.

One `ml` gotcha that only surfaces at runtime (compile and tidy pass it):
**dotted placeholder names** (`[[back.req.url]]`, `[[prev.url]]`) only work via the
function form with a quoted hash key —
`dw.ml('.key', { 'back.req.url' => "...", spid => spid })` — since a quoted dotted
key is valid in a TT hash literal. The filter form's named args
(`| ml( back.req.url = ... )`) won't parse a dotted key. (Relatedly, you can't pipe
`| ml` *inside* an expression at all — a ternary, a `_` concat, a `form.*`
argument; see **Forms** below.)

### Helpers and methods

- **`dw.*`** — `dw.form_auth`, `dw.create_url(...)`, `dw.ml(...)`, `dw.need_res(...)`,
  `dw.active_resource_group('foundation')`.
- **`form.*`** — `form.textbox`, `form.password`, `form.textarea`, `form.select`,
  `form.checkbox`, `form.radio`, `form.submit`, `form.hidden`. These replace the
  old `LJ::html_*` builders.
- **`site.*`** — `site.root`, `site.imgroot`, `site.name`, `site.nameshort`, …
  (replaces `$LJ::SITEROOT`, `$LJ::SITENAMESHORT`, etc.). Two sources behind
  one namespace: static values (`name`, `domain`, `email.*`, …) are
  compile-time constants from `$site_constants` in `cgi-bin/DW/Template.pm`,
  while `root`, `imgroot`, `jsroot`, `shoproot`, and `statroot` are set
  per-request by the `dw` plugin (`DW::Template::Plugin::new`), since they can
  vary at runtime. **In the dev container `site.root` renders as the empty
  string** — the dev config intentionally blanks `$LJ::SITEROOT` — so
  `href='[% site.root %]/manage/tags'` degrades to a root-relative URL there.
  Don't mistake that for a bug while testing; on production it's the absolute
  base URL.
- **Object methods** are called directly: `u.ljuser_display`, `u.name_html`,
  `u.is_community`, etc.

### Control flow

```tt
[% IF errors.exist %] … [% ELSIF invites.size %] … [% ELSE %] … [% END %]
[% FOREACH inv IN invites %] … [% loop.index %] / [% loop.count %] … [% END %]
```

### Forms

Always emit the CSRF token inside a POST form, and pair it with `form_auth => 1`
on the controller:

```tt
<form method="post" action="[% site.root %]/mobile/login">
  [% dw.form_auth %]
  ...
</form>
```

Building form controls (these wrap the old `LJ::html_*`):

```tt
[%# a <select>: items is a FLAT list [ value, text, value, text, ... ] %]
[% form.select( name = 'spcatid', selected = spcatid, items = cat_items ) %]
[% form.textbox( name = 'subject', value = ans.subject, size = 40 ) %]
[% form.submit( name = 'action:save', value = dw.ml('.save') ) %]
[%# extra attributes (e.g. a confirm dialog) pass straight through %]
[% form.submit( name = 'action:delete', value = dw.ml('.delete'),
                onclick = "return confirm('" _ confirm_msg _ "');" ) %]
```

An explicit `value =` always wins; without it `form.*` auto-fills from the posted
form data. Build the flat `items` list for `form.select` in the controller.

`form.checkbox` quirks: always pass an explicit `selected =` — when both `value`
and `selected` are undef the helper `cluck`s a warning into the error log on
every render. A checked box with no `value` posts the literal string `on`, and an
*unchecked* box posts **nothing**, so "was checked, now isn't" can only be
detected server-side by pairing it with a hidden field recording the old state
(the mood theme editor's `<moodid>inherit` / `<moodid>oldinh` pair).

`confirm_msg` above is precomputed in the controller on purpose: the `|` filter
only works at a directive's **top level**, never inside an expression. So a
filter inside a `form.*` argument, a `_` concatenation, or a ternary —
`onclick = "...('" _ ('.k' | ml) _ "')"` and `[% cond ? '.a' | ml : '.b' | ml %]`
— is a parse error ("unexpected token (|)"). Compute the value in the controller,
or assign it first (`[% msg = '.k' | ml %]`) and reference the plain variable.
These parse errors only surface at render time — `t/00-compile.t` won't catch them.

### Recursive structures

A TT `BLOCK` can render a tree (nested categories, the mood hierarchy) by
`INCLUDE`-ing itself — `INCLUDE` localizes its arguments, so the inner call's
`moods` doesn't clobber the outer one (`PROCESS` would):

```tt
[%- BLOCK mood_list %]
<ul class='mood-list'>
  [%- FOREACH mood IN moods %]
  <li>
    <strong>[% mood.name %]</strong>
    ...
    [% INCLUDE mood_list moods = mood.children IF mood.children.size %]
  </li>
  [%- END %]
</ul>
[%- END %]

[% INCLUDE mood_list moods = mood_tree %]
```

Build the nested data structure (arrayrefs of hashrefs with a `children` key) in
the controller; keep the template a dumb renderer.

### Client-side (JS-driven) pages

Some pages are thin server-side shells around a jQuery/AJAX app (e.g.
`js/subfilters.js`). Two rules:

- **Copy every element `id`/`class` the JS hooks verbatim** — the JS finds
  elements by id, so the markup must match exactly.
- **Inject the per-request JS globals** the script needs, from controller
  values:
  ```tt
  <script type="text/javascript">
  DW.currentUser = '[% remote.user %]';
  DW.userIsPaid = [% remote.is_paid ? 'true' : 'false' %];
  </script>
  ```

When emitting a Perl string into JavaScript, escape it with the `js` filter — but
note `js` is `LJ::ejs_string`, which **includes the surrounding quotes**. Write
`var x = [% val | js %];` (→ `var x = "…";`), *not* `'[% val | js %]'`, or you
double-quote it. To escape without quotes (e.g. building a string in the
controller), use `LJ::ejs`.

### Inline `<head>` JavaScript → a static file

BML pages often carry a `<script>` block in their `head<=` section, hooked up
with `<body onload="...">`. Extract it to `htdocs/js/<page>.js`, load it from the
template —

```tt
[% dw.need_res( { group => "foundation" }, 'js/moodtheme-editor.js' ) %]
```

— and replace the `onload` hook with a `DOMContentLoaded` listener inside the
file (there's no body tag to hang attributes on in a sitescheme template):

```js
document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', function () {
    var form = document.getElementById('editform');
    if (form == undefined) return;   // page rendered a non-editor mode
    ...
});
```

> **A NEW file under `htdocs/` 404s in `??` concat URLs until you run
> `bin/build-static.sh`.** The sitescheme bundles resources as
> `/js/??jquery.js,foo.js,...`, and the concat handler serves those from the
> compiled static directory (`$LJ::STATDOCS`), not `htdocs/` — so the browser
> gets `text/plain` and refuses to execute the bundle ("Refused to execute
> script ... MIME type"). The *single-file* URL (`/js/foo.js`) falls back to
> `htdocs/` and works all along, which masks the problem. Run
> `bin/build-static.sh` after adding any new static file.

---

## 4. Translation strings (`.text`)

The `.text` file format is unchanged: `.key=value`, one per stanza, with
`[[placeholder]]` interpolation.

One exception: if an old `.text` value contains embedded BML tags (e.g.
`<?p … p?>`, `<?h1 … h1?>`, `<?de … de?>`), TT won't process them — they render
literally. Move that wrapping markup (`<p>`, `<h1>`, `<div class='de'>`, …) into
the template and keep the `.text` value as plain text. (`/support/help`'s intro
paragraph hit this.)

**Preserve history with `git mv`** when the conversion is 1:1:

```bash
git mv htdocs/mobile/login.bml.text views/mobile/login.tt.text
```

If you are restructuring (splitting a page, renaming many keys), it's fine to
delete the old file and write a fresh one instead.

(Heads-up: if you `git mv` but then rewrite the file heavily in the same commit,
git may stop showing it as a rename — it might even pair the `.bml`→`.tt` markup
files instead. That's cosmetic; the end state is what matters. Either way, after
the migration confirm the old `htdocs/<path>.bml.text` is actually gone, not left
behind as a duplicate.)

### Repointing cross-file references (mandatory)

Find every other file that referenced the old keys by full path and repoint them
to the new `.tt` keys — otherwise those pages break:

```bash
grep -rn "/mobile/login.bml" --include='*.tt' --include='*.pm' .
```

```diff
- text = dw.ml( '/manage/invites.bml.title2' )
+ text = dw.ml( '/manage/invites.tt.title' )
```

This includes **shared Perl modules**, not just other pages: a library can build
its error strings from the page's keys (`DW::Mood` returns
`/manage/moodthemes.bml.error.*` from `set_picture` and `create_moodtheme`).
Rename those references in the module to the new `.tt.*` path — and since the
keys are still live, they must **not** go into `deadphrases.dat`.

### Shipping the new strings (no load step needed)

There is no `texttool.pl load` step in a migration. On production,
`LJ::Lang::get_text` auto-loads a missing general-domain string from the
shipped `.text` file on demand and persists it; dev servers read the files
directly. So moving `foo.bml.text` → `foo.tt.text` and shipping the code is the
whole job — the new `.tt.*` keys appear as they're first requested.

### Retiring old keys in `deadphrases.dat` (recommended)

`bin/upgrading/texttool.pl load` is **purely additive** — it never deletes keys
that disappear from source. Old keys are removed by listing them in
`bin/upgrading/deadphrases.dat`:

```
general /mobile/login.bml.form.button
general /mobile/login.bml.form.password
...
```

and then running `bin/upgrading/texttool.pl deadphrases`, a separate, explicit
command — *intentionally* not part of `load`, so keys a migration moved survive
on hosts still running the old code. Run it once the new code is live
everywhere. In a migration PR you only add the `deadphrases.dat` entries; the
command run is an ops step.

The *mandatory* step is repointing cross-file references (above); deadphrasing
is the *tidy* step.

> `DW::FormErrors` keys are the exception — they resolve at *render* time, so

### Untranslated (hardcoded) strings

Many BML pages have user-visible text hardcoded in English instead of in `$ML{}`.
How much to internationalize is a judgment call (like CSS, §8): extract prose
(sentences, paragraphs, the page title) into `.tt.text`, but it's fine to leave
short control labels and dropdown option values hardcoded as they were. Never
*regress* — anything already an `$ML{}` string must stay an ML string.

## 5. Errors and messages

There are three distinct mechanisms; pick by situation.

### (a) Whole-page error/success — `error_ml` / `success_ml`

Early-return helpers that render the generic `error.tt` / `success.tt`. Because
they resolve the string in the controller, **use full-path keys**:

```perl
return error_ml('/register.tt.error.usernonexistent');
return success_ml( '/register.tt.success.sent', { email => $u->email_raw } );
```

`render_success(...)` is a variant that renders `success-page.tt` with a `scope`,
so *its* `.success.message` / `.success.title` keys resolve page-relative.

### (b) Field/page validation with input preserved — `DW::FormErrors`

The workhorse for forms. Collect errors, then **re-render the same template**
(POST-then-render):

```perl
use DW::FormErrors;
my $errors = DW::FormErrors->new;

$errors->add( 'user', '.login.invalid_username' ) unless $u;   # field error
$errors->add( '',     '.login.ip_banned' )        if $banned;  # page-level (no field)

if ( $errors->exist ) {
    $rv->{errors} = $errors;
    return DW::Template->render_template( 'foo.tt', $rv );
}
```

`DW::FormErrors` keys resolve at render time against the template scope, so
relative `.key` codes are correct here. In a sitescheme template, render them
with the shared components:

```tt
[% INCLUDE components/errors.tt errors = errors %]                   [%# page-level list %]
[% INCLUDE components/error.tt error_name = 'email' errors = errors %] [%# inline, one field %]
```

> `components/errors.tt` emits Foundation `alert-box` markup. On a
> **`no_sitescheme`** page (no Foundation CSS) render errors yourself instead:
>
> ```tt
> [%- IF errors.exist %]
> <p class="error">[% FOREACH err IN errors.get_all %][% err.message %]<br />[% END %]</p>
> [%- END %]
> ```

### (c) Foundation flash banners — `$r->add_msg`

For success/warning banners that the site skin renders automatically (no template
plumbing). Sitescheme pages only:

```perl
$r->add_msg( LJ::Lang::ml('/foo.tt.success'), $r->SUCCESS );  # also ->ERROR, ->WARNING
```

## 6. authas, specify_user, GET args

`controller( authas => 1 )` loads the managed account into `$rv->{u}` (while
`$rv->{remote}` stays the viewer) and provides two renderings:

- **`authas_form`** (preferred, Foundation) — a complete `<form>`; just print it:
  ```tt
  [%- authas_form -%]
  ```
- **`authas_html`** (legacy) — only the `<select>`; you wrap your own GET form:
  ```tt
  <form method="get">[%- authas_html -%]</form>
  ```

`controller( authas => { showall => 1 } )` forwards extra args into the switcher.

For arbitrary query args, read them directly — `$r->get_args->{foo}`. (The
declarative `specify_user => 1` option exists but is rarely used in practice.)

---

## 7. Redirects and route cleanup

Some BML pages had hard-coded routes/redirects in `cgi-bin/Apache/LiveJournal.pm`.
When converting such a page, remove the old entry and reimplement it in the
controller:

```diff
- # confirm
- if ( $uri =~ m!^/confirm/(\w+\.\w+)! ) {
-     return redir( $apache_r, "$LJ::SITEROOT/register.bml?$1" );
- }
```

```perl
DW::Routing->register_regex( '^/confirm/(\w+\.\w+)', \&confirm_handler, app => 1 );
sub confirm_handler {
    my ( $opts, $auth_string ) = @_;
    return DW::Request->get->redirect("/register?$auth_string");
}
```

Most pages, though, are served purely by BML auto-routing (the `.bml` path *is*
the URL) and need no `Apache/LiveJournal.pm` change — just the `register_string`
in the new controller.

## 8. CSS

Judgment call, not a rule:

- **Inline** small, page-specific styling into a `sections.head` BLOCK (sitescheme)
  or the document `<head>` (standalone). This is right for a dozen lines of
  page-local CSS.
- **Keep/move to a `.css` file** loaded via `dw.need_res(...)` when the styling is
  substantial, shared across pages, or already a component stylesheet:
  ```tt
  [%- dw.need_res( { group => "foundation" } "stc/css/components/tables-as-list.css" ) -%]
  ```

## 9. BML → TT cheatsheet

| BML | TT / controller |
|-----|-----------------|
| `<?page title=>… body<= … <=body page?>` | `sections.title` + template body |
| `<?_code … _code?>` (logic) | the controller `.pm` |
| `return "<?needlogin?>"` | `controller( anonymous => 0 )` |
| `LJ::get_remote()` | `$rv->{remote}` |
| `LJ::did_post()` | `$r->did_post` |
| `LJ::check_form_auth()` | `form_auth => 1` (+ `[% dw.form_auth %]`) |
| `%POST` / `%GET` | `$r->post_args` / `$r->get_args` |
| `%POST` multi-value (`split /\0/`) | `$r->post_args->get_all('field')` |
| `<?requirepost?>` | `error_ml('bml.requirepost')` |
| `$ML{'.key'}` / `BML::ml('.key', {…})` | `'.key' \| ml` / `'.key' \| ml( a => … )` |
| `LJ::need_res(...)` / `LJ::set_active_resource_group(...)` | same in controller, or `dw.need_res` / `dw.active_resource_group` in template |
| `LJ::img(...)` | `dw.img(...)` |
| `LJ::html_select` / `html_text` / `html_textarea` / `html_submit` | `form.select` / `form.textbox` / `form.textarea` / `form.submit` |
| `LJ::ljuser($u)` string-building | `u.ljuser_display` |
| `BML::redirect(...)` | `$r->redirect(...)` |
| `$LJ::SITEROOT` | `site.root` |
| `$LJ::SITENAMESHORT` | `site.nameshort` |
| `<?p … p?>` / `<?h1 … h1?>` / `<?de … de?>` | `<p>…</p>` / `<h1>…</h1>` / `<div class='de'>…</div>` |
| `BML::get_query_string()` | `$r->query_string` (raw — for non-`key=value` query strings) |
| `%FORM` (merged GET+POST) | `my %FORM = ( %{$r->get_args}, %{$r->post_args} )` |
| `LJ::bad_input($ML{'.k'})` | `error_ml("$scope.k")`, or `render_template('error.tt', { message => $str })` for dynamic text — a single string only; `error.tt` prints `message` raw, so an arrayref renders as `ARRAY(0x…)` (join first) |

## 10. Worked examples

### `/mobile/login` — a standalone form

A small standalone (`no_sitescheme`) page. Highlights every core pattern:

- **Standalone document** — the `.tt` emits its own `<html>`/`<head>`; the
  controller passes `{ no_sitescheme => 1 }`.
- **Anonymous + CSRF** — `controller( anonymous => 1, form_auth => 1 )` with
  `[% dw.form_auth %]` in the form (the original BML had no CSRF token; the
  conversion adds one).
- **`DW::FormErrors`** — invalid username / bad password / IP-ban each `->add`
  an error and re-render the form (the original printed a bare error string with
  no form). Errors are rendered with plain markup because there's no Foundation
  CSS on a standalone page.
- **Preserved behavior** — a plain GET while logged in logs the user out (the
  "log out" link on `/mobile/`); success redirects to `/mobile/?t=<time>`.
- **`git mv`** — `htdocs/mobile/login.bml.text` → `views/mobile/login.tt.text`,
  no content change.

See `cgi-bin/DW/Controller/Mobile/Login.pm` and `views/mobile/login.tt`.

### `/manage/subscriptions/filters` — a JS-driven sitescheme page

A login-required page that's almost entirely a static shell for a jQuery app
(`js/subfilters.js`). Resources are loaded in the controller (one needs
`$LJ::OLD_RES_PRIORITY`); the template preserves every `cf-*` element id and
injects `DW.currentUser` / `DW.userIsPaid`. Prose is ML'd, short labels left
hardcoded. See `cgi-bin/DW/Controller/Manage/Subscriptions/Filters.pm`.

### `/support/stock_answers` — per-object privchecks + multi-action POST

A support-admin tool. Access control is per-category (not a global `privcheck`),
done by hand with `error_ml` denials. Three `action:*` buttons create / save /
delete rows in `support_answers` directly, each ending in a POST-then-redirect
with an `added` / `saved` / `deleted` flag the GET branch shows as a message. Two
render modes (new-answer form, listing). See
`cgi-bin/DW/Controller/Support/StockAnswers.pm`.

### `/manage/moodthemes` — Foundation restyle, recursive template, extracted JS

The custom mood theme editor, a 511-line BML page with three render modes
(theme list, per-mood editor, save results). Shows most of the Foundation-era
patterns at once: before/after screenshots in the PR (§13); a recursive
`BLOCK`/`INCLUDE` rendering the nested mood tree (data built by a `mood_tree`
helper in the controller); inline head JS extracted to
`htdocs/js/moodtheme-editor.js` with a `DOMContentLoaded` hook; `form.checkbox`
inherit toggles paired with hidden `oldinh` old-state fields; field names that
are object ids scanned via `keys %$post`; `authas` for community themes; and
porting-time hardening (ownership check on "use", `LJ::ehtml` on the echoed
picture URL, null guards in the JS). See
`cgi-bin/DW/Controller/Manage/Moodthemes.pm` and `views/manage/moodthemes.tt`.

## 11. Before you push

Run inside the devcontainer and fix any failures (CI runs these and fails the
build even for files you didn't touch):

```bash
perl extlib/bin/tidyall -a   # auto-format
perl t/02-tidy.t             # verify formatting
perl t/00-compile.t          # verify all modules compile
```

Templates (`.tt`) and `.text` files are not perltidy'd, but the controller `.pm`
must be tidy. If your migration leans on the string system in any unusual way,
also run `perl t/ml.t` (covers `set_text`/`get_text`, caching, language
fallback, and the production auto-load-from-file path).

---

## 12. Testing it live

```bash
perl bin/starman --port 8080
```

Then exercise every path — GET, each validation failure, and the success
redirect — with `curl` (use a cookie jar and copy the `lj_form_auth` token from
the GET into your POST). Confirm the URL, the rendered strings, and (for forms)
the redirect/session behavior.

**A new controller needs a full Starman restart.** `LJ::ModuleLoader` globs the
controller directory once at startup, so a freshly added `DW::Controller::*`
returns 404 until you stop and start Starman (a worker respawn won't pick it up).
Watch out: `pkill -f starman` also matches the shell running it — kill the
listener on the port (`fuser -k 8080/tcp`), or use a pattern that excludes your
own command.

**Per-worker Perl caches go stale — and can silently defeat *saves*, not just
display.** Long-lived workers cache DB rows in package hashes (e.g.
`%LJ::CACHE_MOOD_THEME`), and each Starman worker has its own copy. The obvious
symptom is stale data on a GET, but the dangerous one is a save handler whose
"skip if nothing changed" check reads through such a cache: it concludes
nothing changed and silently drops a real update — the success page renders,
the database doesn't move. If you've modified data out-of-band (a CLI one-liner,
direct SQL), restart Starman before testing mutations through the page.

## 13. Screenshots: before and after

Conversions restyle to Foundation, so every migration PR carries a before/after
screenshot comparison, one row per page state.

1. **Screenshot the BML page FIRST, before converting anything.** Capture every
   distinct state — main view, editor/form, post-action results, the
   no-permission (free-account) variant. Once the `.bml` is deleted you can't
   go back; recreating the old page from git for screenshots is far more work.
2. After converting, capture the same states from the TT page, with the same
   data, so the comparison is apples-to-apples.
3. Use **`bin/dev/screenshot`** (inside the devcontainer; installs headless
   Chrome from Google's signed apt repo on first run):
   ```bash
   bin/dev/screenshot --user test_user --password ... --out /tmp/before-main.png /manage/moodthemes
   ```
   `--restart` bounces Starman first (needed when the route is new, §12). The
   capture is full-page; the seeded test accounts (`bin/dev/seed-testdata`)
   give you stable users in every state (`test_user`, `test_friend`,
   `test_paid`, `test_comm`).
4. **POST-result pages** (e.g. a save-results screen) aren't reachable by URL.
   Fetch the POST response with `curl` (cookie jar + `lj_form_auth` token),
   save the body as a temporary file under `htdocs/`, screenshot that URL, then
   delete the file.
5. **Embedding in the PR:** the `gh` CLI cannot create GitHub user-attachment
   uploads. Instead, commit the PNGs to an **orphan branch on your fork** and
   reference them with SHA-pinned `raw.githubusercontent.com` URLs in a
   markdown table (`| Before | After |`). SHA-pinning keeps the images stable;
   the branch must outlive the PR — don't delete it after merge.
