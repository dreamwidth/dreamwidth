  <title>Core &bml; blocks</title>
  <para>
    Core blocks are predefined blocks that are named with a leading underscore. 
    Most core blocks have a higher purpose than simple template use:

        <literal>&lt;?_code _code?&gt;</literal> blocks are perhaps the most useful feature of 
        &bml; outside of the ability to have global site templates. 
        These blocks allow template authors to embed pieces of executable Perl code 
        within the <literal>bml</literal> pages that get executed on the server.

        The code you write gets executed in its own package (namespace) called 
        <computeroutput>BMLCodeBlock::</computeroutput>.
        Any variables you declare in one code block on a page without using 
        <literal>my</literal> are carried on to the next <literal>_code</literal> block.

        Because the &bml; parser must evaluate everything on the page before sending the 
        &http; headers, make sure you don&apos;t print anything. 
        Any output printed to <literal>STDOUT</literal> will just be interpreted as 
        &http; headers. How the <literal>_code</literal> blocks work is 
        that you need to return a value at the end.
        Whatever value your code fragment returns is what the block evaluates to. 
        Usually what you end up doing is building a string, concatenating things to it 
        over and over, and then returning it at the end.
