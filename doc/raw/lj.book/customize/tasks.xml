  <title>Running your own Maintenance Tasks</title>
  <para><remark>
    (FIXME - describe the different tasks from ljmaint.pl, etc... note: build.pl should auto-extract the taskinfo.txt text and put it in here somewhere?)    
</remark></para>
  <para>
    <literal>bin/maint/taskinfo.txt</literal> is provided.  Don't
    change that.  But go ahead and add a new file,
    <literal>taskinfo-local.txt</literal> beside it in the same
    format, which <literal>ljmaint.pl</literal> will find and use.
