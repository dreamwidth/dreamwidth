At the beginning and end of the month, there may be blank squares on the calendar.  For instance, if the 1st of the month lands on a Wednesday, the Sunday-Tuesdays squares are non-existent.  In the construction of a pretty HTML table, it will be necessary to make a TD cell with a COLSPAN equal to the number of empty days.  If you are not making your calendar view look like a calendar, just leave this variable blank.  Note: this variable is used in the %%emptydays_beg%% and %%emptydays_end%% properties of the [var[CALENDAR_WEEK]] variable.

The number of empty days.  Useful as the COLSPAN of table cells.

For instance, this is useful if you want to display a link to the [view[day]] view to see what the user's events for that day were.  On a day with zero events, you wouldn't want a link, so you'd put your HTML into this variable, not in [var[CALENDAR_DAY]].  However, in [var[CALENDAR_DAY]], make sure you use %%dayevent%% somewhere.
