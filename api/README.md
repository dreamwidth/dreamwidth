This folder contains the YAML files used to generate and validate [OpenAPI](https://openapis.org) routes for Dreamwidth, and to build the spec file supplied to end users. `src` contains the files you should edit - reusable components should go into `src\components\` and can then be referenced using JS Schema reference notation (eg, `$ref: components/schemas/username.yaml`). This cuts down on items that need to be retyped, and keeps descriptions of items consistent across different endpoints. `dist` contains the compiled YAML files that are used by the Perl endpoint controllers. Because YAML has no mechanism for file includes, there is unfortunately still a manual step required to rebuild the `dist` files when the `src` files are changed. First install node and then the necessary packages (`npm install` from inside this folder), and then run the `build.js` file (`node build.js`). This will compile the YAML files, and print any errors encountered along the way to the terminal.
